## User Story
- [x]  Build a product carousel on [https://www.lcwaikiki.com](https://www.lcwaikiki.com/) similar to the one visible on the websiteâ€™s product page.
- [x]  To achieve this, you need to retrieve the product list using a GET request from the following URL: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sevindi/5765c5812bbc8238a38b3cf52f233651/raw/56261d81af8561bf0a7cf692fe572f9e1e91f372/products.json
- [x]  The code should only run on the product pages and must be appended after the element with ".product-detail" class within the product page's structure.
- [x]  The carousel should include a title with the text "You Might Also Like".
- [x]  Users should be able to view six and a half products, and by clicking the arrow buttons, the carousel should smoothly slide one product to the right or left according to the direction of the arrow.
- [x]  When a user clicks on a product, the respective product page should open in a new tab. Clicking on the heart icon should fill it with a blue color, and this preference should be stored in the local storage.
- [x]  Upon running the code for the second time after refreshing the page, it should retrieve the product list from the local storage instead of making another fetch request.
- [x]  Additionally, the code should ensure that the favorited products with filled hearts are displayed.
- [x]  The design must be responsive and suitable for all platforms, including mobile, tablet, and desktop. Viewable product amount might vary according to the resolution.

## Development Summary

*  The carousel design was created from scratch. No code was copied from the existing carousel.
*  All items in the case have been resolved.
*  Since it was requested to show "six and a half" cards, this view was statically achieved. This led to the images resizing responsively without breaking the design.
*  The carousel design was aimed to be pixel-perfect with minimal error margin, similar to other areas on the LCW site.
*  Since pixel-perfect was not the primary request and the story did not include additional information about similarity to other blocks, the best possible design was targeted.
*  The left and right arrow buttons disappear in mobile view, and text overflow and line break properties are protected.
*  The code was developed using functional and object-oriented programming principles to maintain clean code. However, abstractions and type definitions were kept to a minimum to avoid over-engineering.
*  The arrow and heart features are fully functional.
*  Controls were added to ensure that the card size does not change when multiple carousels are added.
